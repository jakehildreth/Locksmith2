# Locksmith 2
## An AD CS toolkit for AD Admins, Offensive Security Professionals, and Filthy Red Teamers

### Overview
Locksmith 2 is intended to be the next generation in the Locksmith line of open-source PowerShell tooling. It will super-charge the basic Locksmith "find and fix" experience by adding a TUI and a granular set of cmdlets to help end users perform more targeted AD CS security-related tasks. In addition to new new features, Locksmith 2 will improve existing features with better reporting, more educational resources, clearer remediation guidance, and deeper risk analysis. Finally, Locksmith 2 should make development processes much easier by eliminating duplicate code and introducing unit testing.
